/**
 A `scatter3d` series. If the `type` option is not specified, it is inherited from `chart.type`.
 
 Configuration options for the series are given in three levels:
 
 1. Options for all series in a chart are defined in the `plotOptions.series` object.
 
 2. Options for all `scatter3d` series are defined in `plotOptions.scatter3d`.
 
 3. Options for one single series are given in `the series instance array`.

    plotOptions: {

            // general options for all series
        },

/**
Apply a jitter effect for the rendered markers. When plotting discrete values, a little random noise may help telling the points apart. The jitter setting applies a random displacement of up to `n` axis units in either direction. So for example on a horizontal X axis, setting the `jitter.x` to 0.24 will render the point in a random position between 0.24 units to the left and 0.24 units to the right of the true axis position. On a category axis, setting it to 0.5 will fill up the bin and make the data appear continuous. When rendered on top of a box plot or a column series, a jitter value of 0.24 will correspond to the underlying series' default [groupPadding](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.column.groupPadding) and [pointPadding](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/plotOptions.column.pointPadding) settings.
