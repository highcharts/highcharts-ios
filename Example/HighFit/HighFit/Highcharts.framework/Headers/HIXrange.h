A `xrange` series. If the `type` option is not specified, it is inherited from `chart.type`.

Configuration options for the series are given in three levels:
 
1. Options for all series in a chart are defined in the `plotOptions.series` object.

2. Options for all `xrange` series are defined in `plotOptions.xrange`.

3. Options for one single series are given in `the series instance array`.
